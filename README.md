# PhpStorm inspection profile for Contao

This package includes a PhpStorm inspection profile for Contao. The profiles
assume that the [EA Extended][1] plugin is installed.

## Installation

First download or clone the repo, then open PhpStorm and navigate to
"Preferences" → "Inspections". Click the "Show Scheme Actions" button next to
the profile drop-down and choose "Import Profile…".

## Adjustments

The following adjustments have been made compared to the default scheme:

**phpDoc comments**

Duplicating meta information in both type hints and phpDoc comments will lead
to inconsistent data, therefore only document what is not already in the method
signature.

Code snippet with duplicate meta data:

```php
class Foo
{
    /**
     * Description of what the method does.
     * 
     * @param string $str
     * @param int    $int
     * @param bool   $bool
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public method bar(string $str, int $int, bool $bool): array
    {
    }
}
```

Code snippet without duplicate meta data:

```php
class Foo
{
    /**
     * Description of what the method does.
     */
    public method bar(string $str, int $int, bool $bool): array
    {
    }
}
```

Therefore, do not warn if a PHPDoc comment does not match the function/method
signature.

**Binary-unsafe `fopen()` usage**

Contemporary systems do not require the b-modifier for compatibility anymore,
therefore do not promote its usage.

**Warn about case mismatch in method call or class usage**

Even though method calls are case-insensitive in PHP, it seems a good practice
to use the correct case.

**Do not warn if the security advisories package is missing**

Even though the security advisories package is a good thing, it is not always
necessary to add it to your `composer.json` file (e.g. if you maintain your own
security meta package or if you use the [Symfony Security Checker][2] instead),
therefore do not warn if it is not present.

**Do not warn if `strtr()` could be replaced with `str_replace()`**

After the PHP `strtr()` implementation [has been reworked][3] in 2013, it is
more effective than `str_replace()` when replacing single characters.
Therefore, do not suggest replacing it.

**Exception handling**

Contao does not add `@throws` annotations to every method that calls another
method that calls another method that might throw an exception. Instead, it
adds `@throws` to indicate that an exception should be handled in a try/catch
block in contrast to letting it bubble up to the general exception handler.

See [contao/contao#3816][4] for more information.

**Do not warn about undefined fields**

Contao models use `@property` tags to define the fields which are accessible
through magic methods. However, since models can be extended and there is no
way to add `@property` tags on the fly, a lot of false-positive warnings about
undefined fields will be generated. 

**Do not warn about unused parameters**

Sometimes using an interface or a hook requires a certain method signature,
even though not all arguments are used in the method body, therefore disable
the check.

**Do not warn about static method invocation via `->`**

Contao uses adapters to allow unit-testing methods of the old Contao 3
framework. Since most of these methods are static but are not invoked
statically through the adapter, disable this check.

**Do not warn about unsupported string offset operations**

PhpStorm generates a lot of false-positive warnings about unsupported string
offset operations when working with the globals array like this:

```php
$GLOBALS['TL_LANG']['MSC']['articlePicker'] = 'Article picker';
```

Therefore, disable this check.
